# Chapter 01

- To calculate binary search's operation time, use *log2(N)*, then round the result up.
- In Python 3, "//" will return an integer result if the dividend and the divisor are both integers, the result has been rounded down. "/" always returns a float result, "//" can also get a float when at least one of the dividend or the divisor is a float.
- The features of logarithmic curve: The growth rate is gradually increasing when approaching the limit 0, exponent curve is on the contrary.
- Big O notation indicates the operation time of the worst case.
- *O(log n)* < *O(n)* < *O(n\*log n)* < *O(n^2)* < *O(n!)*
- Binary search: *O(log n)*
- Simple search: *O(n)*
